# Backend PR — Delete-account 2FA gate

Split out of Phase 7.2 (Settings: preferences, API access, referral,
privacy) because it touches `apps/web/app/api/**`, which
`docs/FRONTEND_REBUILD_PLAN.md`'s frozen zone (§4) reserves for
backend-track (§7) sessions only. This PR targets `main` directly, on
its own branch, independent of `frontend-v2`.

## What changed

`apps/web/app/api/user/delete-account/route.ts`: if the account has
2FA enabled (`users.twoFactorEnabled`), deletion now also requires a
valid TOTP or backup code in the request body's `twoFactorCode`,
checked via better-auth's own `auth.api.verifyTOTP` /
`auth.api.verifyBackupCode` — the same server-side primitives
`two-factor-section.tsx` already drives client-side through
`authClient.twoFactor.*`. A non-2FA account's flow is byte-identical
to before.

New error responses (400): `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED` (code omitted),
`INVALID_TWO_FACTOR_CODE` (code present but wrong). Existing responses
(`PASSWORD_REQUIRED`, `INCORRECT_PASSWORD`, `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`,
`TOO_MANY_ATTEMPTS`) are unchanged.

This closes the gap in the plan's own §6 Phase 7.2 text: "delete
account (password confirm; 2FA code if enabled)."

## Compatibility with the frontend

The Phase 7.2 frontend PR (`features/settings/sections/data-privacy/
delete-account-dialog.tsx`) already handles both new error codes and
was written/shipped independent of this PR's merge order:
- Deployed against today's (unpatched) route: a 2FA-enabled account
  deletes on password alone — no error, no crash, same as every
  account before Phase 7.2.
- Once this PR merges: the already-shipped frontend picks up the 2FA
  step automatically, no frontend redeploy needed.

Merge either order; no coordination required beyond this note.

## Not verified

Better-auth's exact `verifyTOTP` / `verifyBackupCode` server-side
export names and error shape on the installed version — this sandbox
has no network/`node_modules` to import better-auth and confirm
against the real package. The client-side calls this mirrors
(`authClient.twoFactor.verifyTotp` / `verifyBackupCode`) are real and
already in use elsewhere in this codebase, but the *server-side*
`auth.api.*` names are inferred from better-auth's usual client/server
naming symmetry, not confirmed against source. If either name is
wrong, it's a one-line fix in the route (it fails loudly — a wrong
method name throws at call time, not silently) and the two `catch`
blocks already narrow on `APIError` only, so anything else (e.g. a
`TypeError` from calling a nonexistent method) will surface immediately
in CI/preview rather than being swallowed as "invalid code."

## How to verify

- `apps/api`'s Testcontainers suite doesn't cover this route (it's a
  Next.js route handler in `apps/web`, not a tRPC procedure) — add a
  route-level integration test if this codebase has a harness for
  `apps/web` API routes; otherwise this needs a live preview pass:
  - Non-2FA throwaway account: delete-account completes on password
    alone (regression check — must still work exactly as before).
  - 2FA-enabled throwaway account: submitting only a password returns
    `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`; a wrong TOTP/backup code returns
    `INVALID_TWO_FACTOR_CODE`; a correct one completes the deletion and
    signs the session out.
  - Confirm the deleted 2FA account's `twoFactor` row is actually gone
    (existing anonymization transaction already deletes it — verify
    that still runs after the new check, not bypassed by an early
    return).
